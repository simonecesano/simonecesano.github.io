## purpose

With this tool xou can write complex calculations in a narrative text
format so you can annotate their logic, have the tool perform
calculations, and output them indifferent formats (tabular, text and
Powerpoint).

## how does it work

Type up your calculations in markdown format (see [full documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
and [a
cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet))
in the "Input" tab. To see the calculated output use the "Table"
tab. Other output formats (Excel, PowerPoint) will be coming soon.

## input format
	  
- numbers followed by k, M, B get replaced by same number multiplied by thousand, million, billion respectively: 23k results in 23000
- numbers followed by % get replaced by same number divided by 100
- " @ " , " x " (watch surrounding spaces) get replaced by multiplication "12 @ 15" results in 12 * 15 => 180 
- '_' gets replaced by the result of the previous line
- a line ending in '=' gets added to the subtotal
- a line beginning in '=' outputs the running subtotal and resets it
- a line beginning in '==' outputs the grandtotal

## example

    # Food and drinks
    
    - 10 cokes @ 1 EUR => drinks =
    - 8 beers @ 1.6 EUR => drinks =
    - 1 bottle rum @ 13 EUR => drinks =
    = drinks
    
    - 6 steaks @ 2.4 EUR => food =
    - 0.5 kg salad @ 2 EUR => food =
    = food

    == grand total
